## CSS tab
The CSS tab contains two text areas, edit the CSS in `#container` to style the gray box container on the right. Clicking on the boxes labeled 0-5 toggles the `.selected` class on them, allowing them to be styled by the `.selected` text area.

## Flex Container
The flex container is the gray box on the right of the screen. The **main** and **cross** axis are labeled on the side of the box, and updates based on the flexbox properties applied. Property values that affects the **main** axis are labeled in **red** and values that affects the **cross** axis are labeled in **blue**.
          
### Resize
The flex container is resizable, you can adjust the size of the flex container by draging the white label on the lower right of the container.

### Add/Remove Boxes
You can click on the add button on the top right corner to add boxes. You can remove boxes by dragging them to the trash can on the top right corner.
          
### Selection
Clicking on boxes toggles the `.selected` class on them, allowing them to be styled by the `.selected` text area in the CSS tab.
